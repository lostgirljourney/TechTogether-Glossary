This is a website where you can find the meaning of the words which is generally used in the LGBTQIA+ community. Here, you will also get a list of slang which you should avoid while communicating with people in the community.

## Features

There are two pages.

## Inspiration

Since we communicate with people in the community, we discover ourselves unaware of the terminologies used in a broad aspect. Hence, a dictionary specifically for these words is necessary to understand terms.

## How I built it

- Used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the website along with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) [[Daisy UI](https://daisyui.com/)] for the making of the website.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/lostgirljourney/TechTogether-Glossary) for repository.
- [LGBTQIA-Dictionary](https://rainbowcenter.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/2262/2019/01/LGBTQIA-Dictionary-FINAL-Spring-18.pdf) for the words and their definitions.

## Accomplishments that I am proud of

Learned about debouncing as well as the full-stack aspect of Next.js.
